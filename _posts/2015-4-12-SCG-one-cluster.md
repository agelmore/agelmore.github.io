The megahit assembly of reads that aligned with Fusobacterium genomes finished, and I'm interested to see how pure the assembly is. Because I already figured out how to use CONCOCT's [single copy core gene validation](http://agelmore.github.io/2015/02/28/Single-copycore.html), I wondered if I could use this pipeline **without clustering**.
