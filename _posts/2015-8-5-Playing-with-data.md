In my previous posts I did pangenome construction, read alignment, and organized output (with the script [sharedfile.py](https://github.com/agelmore/Pangenome/blob/master/sharedfile.py)). Here, I want to play with this output to understand my data better and come up with a plan for comparing samples.
