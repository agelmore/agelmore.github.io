When I set get_homologues to allow clusters with a single gene, I get a ton of singleton clusters (58% of the total number of clusters). I think that's because a lot of the genes in the draft genomes are incomplete. For now I removed those clusters, but I want to check to see if those incomplete genes are in the other clusters.

**Task:** Blast the singleton clusters against the other clusters to see if they are present there (and incomplete) or if they are in fact novel genes.
